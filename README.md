# MinVkImgui

Minimal Vulkan Imgui example.

This repository contains a minimal example of integrating ImGui with Vulkan. It demonstrates how to set up a Vulkan
application and render ImGui interfaces.

It is also using [DepManager](https://github.com/Silmaen/DepManager) to manage dependencies.

It is inspired by
the [official ImGui Vulkan example](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/examples/example_glfw_vulkan/main.cpp)
but conformed to my personal coding style.

It uses the basic structure of my other Vulkan projects.
